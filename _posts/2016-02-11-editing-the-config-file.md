# The Jekyll config.yml file

* The \_config file is used for settings that apply to your whole site and which rarely need to be changed.

* This includes title of the site, description, as well as [many advanced settings](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) about how Jekyll interprets the markdown files, creates URLs, etc.

* \_config.yml uses the Yaml format.

<p><strong>Activity</strong><br/>
1. <em>Using the built-in GitHub editor</em>, edit your config file to add your own name and site information.<br/>
2. Edit the posts and pages of your newly forked site. You may want to paste in the content of the markdown files you create earlier.<br/>
3. View your pages online and revise as needed.<br/>
4. Create new pages and posts. <strong>Remember to use proper filenames, and include yaml frontmatter!</strong><br/>
