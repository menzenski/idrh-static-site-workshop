## The Jekyll config.yml file

The config file is used for settings that affect your whole blog, values
which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.

_config.yml include title, description, as well as many advanced settings about jekyll interprets the markdown files, creates URLs, etc.

_config.yml uses the Yaml format.
