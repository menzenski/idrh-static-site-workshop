# The Jekyll config.yml file

* The \_config file is used for settings that apply to your whole site and which rarely need to be changed.

* This includes title of the site, description, as well as [many advanced settings](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) about how Jekyll interprets the markdown files, creates URLs, etc.

* \_config.yml uses the Yaml format.
