## Jekyll

[**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. It takes your markdown files and puts them together into html files to make a static website.

It runs on your desktop, but it also runs directly within GitHub, which means you can put your markdown files in your GitHub repository and they will automatically be turned into a website.

For today's workshop we will be using GitHub, rather than the Desktop version.
