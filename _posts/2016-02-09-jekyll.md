## Jekyll

* [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. It takes your markdown files and puts them together into html files to make a static website.

* It runs on your desktop, but it also runs directly within GitHub, which means you can put your markdown files in your GitHub repository and they will automatically be turned into a website.

* For today's workshop we will be using GitHub, rather than the Desktop version.

## [The basic Jekyll directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)

* Filenames
* Frontmatter
