## Static vs Dynamic Websites

### Dynamic websites
* assemble pages 'on the fly': when a page is needed, a template is populated with content from a database.
* (e.g. WordPress, Drupal and other CMS-based sites)

### Static websites
* Complete pages are stored on the web server. A page doesn't change once it's put there
* Can be created by hand-coding the HTML, or a web development tool like DreamWeaver, or by static site generators like **Jekyll**

### Advantages of static sites

* speed, security, portability, longevity, ease of maintenance, control

### Limitations of static sites

* community-driven sites can be more difficult to maintain
* same with forums, comments and sites with content that needs to be updated instantaneously
