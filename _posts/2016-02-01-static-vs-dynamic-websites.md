* Dynamic websites dassemble pages 'on the fly': when a page is needed, a
  template is populated with content from a database.

* Static websites store complete pages. A page doesn't change once it's put
  on the web server.

### Advantages of static sites

* speed
* security
* portability
* longevity
* ease of maintenance
* control

### Limitations of static sites

* community-driven sites
* forums
* comments
* heavy data needs
