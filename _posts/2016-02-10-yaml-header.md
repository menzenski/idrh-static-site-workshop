## YAML and the YAML Header

* YAML Ain't Markup Language
* minimalist, human-readable, data structure
* designed to facilitate data interchage and easy readability and use

In Jekyll, every post or page will have a **[YAML header](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)** at the top. It is written in plain text. It contains basic metadata about the page, which also serve as instructions to Jekyll about how to process it or display the content. They work like email headers.
